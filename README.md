GDTuber is a dynamic PNGTuber software made in Godot. It supports voice-reactive avatars, accessories, and a save/load system for multiple profiles. 

## Features
- Support for voice reactive on-screen objects with visual changes or movement (bouncing)
- Support for several individual on-screen objects
- Support for dynamic position, scale, and rotation of on-screen objects
- Audio threshold/sensitivity settings
- Designed for simple OBS integration using transparency or chroma key

## Instructions
1. Select your microphone from the `Input Device` drop down menu at the top.
3. Press the `+` button to create a new avatar
4. Use the `Change Image` button to set an image for the avatar/object (more information in the **Image Setup** section)
6. Use the bottom row of icons to activate the gizmo
    - left click to move the object on screen
    - right click to rotate the object on screen
    - scroll to scale the object on screen
8. Add additional avatars or accessories with the `+` button

### OBS instructions
1. Create a `Game Capture` source
2. Set `Mode` to "Capture specific window"
3. Set `Window` to the GDTuber window
4. Select `Allow Transparency` at the bottom

## Image Setup
Currently, GDTuber supports single-image avatars. If an avatar has a blinking animation, it should take up the bottom half of the image. If an avatar has a talking animation, it should take up the right half of the image. Below is an example avatar featuring both a talking and blinking animation.
